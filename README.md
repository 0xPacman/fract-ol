# Fract'ol

Fractals are created by repeating a simple process in an ongoing feedback loop and they can be generated by a computer calculating a simple equation over and over.
in this project we will see the beauty of mathematics thanks to Benoit Mandelbrot

## The formula

### Requirements

- clang
- x11
- [minilibx](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux)

### How to install
`git clone && make`

### Available fractals:

- [Mandelbrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set)
- [Julia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set)
- [Burning ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Ship_fractal)
- More are coming...


### How to use:
To run:

`./fractol <name of the availeble fractal>`

To run all of them at once:

`make startall`

To use:

- üñ±Ô∏è Scroll up to zoom in
- üñ±Ô∏è Scroll down to zoom out
- ‚å®Ô∏è C : to change colors
- ‚å®Ô∏è Use arrows to navigate
- ‚å®Ô∏è W,A,S,D : for Julia to change the shape

P.s 0.1  : Please run the program on supercomputer for better experiance.

P.s 1.0: : This can be run corractly on MacOS that has already Minilibx lib, i'll fix that later to run on all UNIX machines (Win users i feel sorry for you)

P.s 2.0 : It can be run on linux too but there will be an issue with the keys, i'll fix that as well no worries.
